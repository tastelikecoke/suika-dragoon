         * Fancy ID generator that creates 20-character string identifiers with the following properties:
         *
         * 1. They're based on timestamp so that they sort *after* any existing ids.
         * 2. They contain 72-bits of random data after the timestamp so that IDs won't collide with other clients' IDs.
         * 3. They sort *lexicographically* (so the timestamp is converted to characters that will sort properly).
         * 4. They're monotonically increasing.  Even if you generate more than one in the same timestamp, the
         *    latter ones will sort after the former ones.  We do this by using the previous random bits
         *    but "incrementing" them by 1 (only in the case of a timestamp collision).
